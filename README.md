## 📖 About

MerMommy Creations is a one‑page brand website for a children's party styling and rental business. It blends a playful, storybook aesthetic with practical booking tools, local SEO signals, and a mobile‑first experience.

The site is designed to feel like stepping into an underwater adventure with hand‑crafted seashell cards, floating animations, hidden treasures, and a tone that's equal parts whimsy and wink.

## 🚀 Setup & Deployment

### 1. Local development
Simply open `index.html` in your browser. No build tools, no installs – everything is self‑contained.

### 2. Customise content
- Replace the images in `/images/` with your own.
- Update placeholder links (`#`) for the "Download Now" guide, Terms, and Privacy pages.
- Adjust the contact email address in the `action` attributes of the forms (currently using demo Formspree endpoints). Sign up at [Formspree](https://formspree.io) to get your own form IDs.

### 3. Deploy to production
Upload the entire folder to your web host (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, or any static hosting). Make sure `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` are placed in the **root** (same level as `index.html`).

### 4. Verify forms
Test both forms to ensure submissions reach your inbox. If you change the Formspree endpoints, update them in the HTML.

## 🔍 SEO Notes

- The `<h1>` is keyword‑rich: *"Children's Party Styling in North County San Diego"*
- The playful tagline is moved to a `<p>` below it – keeping the H1 crawler‑friendly.
- Structured data includes `serviceArea` with a GeoCircle for local search.
- Meta tags for `geo.region` and `geo.placename` reinforce location targeting.

---

## 🎨 Design Highlights

- **Shell cards** – Two distinct SVG clip‑paths (original + new) used in the slider, each with its own conic‑gradient background.
- **Pearl glow** – A bright, multi‑coloured radial gradient behind the card content that intensifies on hover.
- **Floating elements** – The shell cards, Kayte's image, and background bubbles all have gentle up‑down motions.
- **Watercolour texture** – A subtle noise overlay on the shells gives them a hand‑painted feel.
