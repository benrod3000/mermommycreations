---

## ✨ Overview

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

**Storybook Experience Over Corporate Website**

The site is designed to feel like an underwater adventure, not a business landing page. Key design principles include:

- **Brutalist-lite aesthetic**, Clean, architectural structure with no rounded corners, using bold borders and intentional spacing for a premium, editorial feel
- **Ocean-inspired color palette**, Soft pastel gradients (lavender to teal to aqua) with accent colors `#8B6C9E` (purple) and `#69DBD3` (teal)
- **Glass-morphism elements**, Transparent, blurred backgrounds create depth without heaviness
- **Storybook narrative**, The user follows a mermaid guide through the site, discovering themes and treasures along the way
- **Premium typography**, Custom Magnolia Sky font for signatures, Fredoka for clean body text
